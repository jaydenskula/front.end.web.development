            I began with creating and styling the home page for my portal. As I said for milestone 1, I wanted a very simple class portal that's easy to 
            navigate. I then went on to formatting my assignments, projects, and process blog page. At the very end of my process, I added some more
            customization and implemented a small animation and drop shadow when the mouse hovers over any of the links. My class portal took about
            3-4 hours to create. It was not particularly difficult to create, but I did run into a few challenges. I often had to reference some old code from
            my previous web class because I did not remember how to implement what I wanted into my class portal. Additionally, formatting sites for mobile is
            a very tedious and annoying process and was my least favorite part of creating this site. I would not change much about how I approached making
            my class portal. I like the result and I believe I did it as efficiently as possible.

            The first line of code was styled in Javascript through the DOM. This completes the first requirement of manipulating a css
            property through the DOM. I killed two birds with one stone in the second line of code. I added an event listener for a mouse click. When the 
            text is clicked on, the text presented changes. This is not a CSS property and it is one type of event of two for this assignment. The final line
            has event listeners for when the mouse hovers over and off the text. When the mouse is hovering over the text, the text changes color. It reverts
            back to the original color if the mouse is not hovering over it. Overall, this assignment was fairly simple. I had a few challenges because it
            has been a few months since I have used Javascript, so I simply had to refresh my memory.

            Present in this assignment:
                - Input type "submit"
                - Input type "number"
                - Input type "datetime-local"
                - Input type "color"
                - 'select' and 'option'
            This was another simple assignment. I had a bit of trouble figuring out the Javascript syntax so that it takes the user input and manipulates
            the page directly based on the input, however with some time I figured it out. I was not too worried about the aesthetics/style of this webpage
            as I was more focused on meeting all the requirements. 

            The first form lets the user enter a number 1-100. Upon clicking submit, the webpage alerts the user with the number they entered. The second
            form has the datetime-local input type. The date and the time that the user clicks is displayed in the console. The third form gives the user
            a list of colors that they could select. Their selection changes the color of the text on the page. The last form is a color picker which manipulates
            the background color of the page.

            I had a bit of trouble finding an API for this assignment as many were blocked by the CORS policy. Unsurprisingly, the biggest
            challenge I had with this assignment was writing the JavaScript. I had the most fun styling the page because I had a lot of 
            creative freedom. I wanted to make my page more interactive so I added a button to generate a new activity on click and styled it. 
            This provides a more intuitive way to call to the API for different text than simply reloading the page by clicking reload at the 
            top of the browser window. Overall, this assignment was short and straight foward.

        <p class="entry-text">
            For my project, I want to create a small text-based adventure in Javascript. The user will be presented with scenarios with which they 
            can take different actions. There will be an animated background that changes based on the scenario and choices the user
            makes.The purpose for my site is to be visually appealing and hopefully something that I can proudly present in my portfolio. The target 
            audience would be anyone who wants to see what I have created during my college career. It will also be a short and sweet little activity 
            for people who are bored.
        </p>

        <p class="entry-text">
            I have a passion for animation so I knew I wanted my project to include it. My project will also be inspired by text-based games like A Dark Room.
            Below is a basic idea of what I want my project to look like:
        </p>

        <img src="/img/wireframe.jpg" width=900>
        <p class="entry-text">
            If the image is not loading, <a href="https://github.com/jaydenskula/front.end.web.development/blob/main/img/wireframe.jpg">click here</a> to view it.</p>
        </p>

        <p class="entry-text">
            For my project, the new JavaScript library I plan on learning is <a href="https://animejs.com/">anime.js</a>. Since I have never utilized this
            library, I plan on beginning with watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vIxQA_bgs">this video</a> as a brief introduction. A
            majority of my webpage will be coded in JavaScript. In other words, my entire project will rely on Javascript for functionality and maximum
            quality user experience. The art for the backgrounds will not be created in JavaScript, however the liveliness of them and the animation will 
            be implemented through JavaScript. In order for it to be compatible with different screen sizes, I plan on changing the sizes of the background
            images and potentially will have to change the animation parameters. I will also have to adjust the size and layout of any text that will
            appear on the screen. My goals for this project are to learn more about JavaScript and animation. I don't want to just finish my 
            project for a completion grade, I want it to be a valuable display of my skills and coding abilities for people to see.

            The biggest hurdle of this assignment was getting started. I was unsure of where to begin to complete this assignment, however once I found
            my footing I was able to complete it with minimal difficulty. The page displays my major, Creative Technology & Design. The console logs out "Hello, my name is
