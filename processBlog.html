            I began with creating and styling the home page for my portal. As I said for milestone 1, I wanted a very simple class portal that's easy to 
            navigate. I then went on to formatting my assignments, projects, and process blog page. At the very end of my process, I added some more
            customization and implemented a small animation and drop shadow when the mouse hovers over any of the links. My class portal took about
            3-4 hours to create. It was not particularly difficult to create, but I did run into a few challenges. I often had to reference some old code from
            my previous web class because I did not remember how to implement what I wanted into my class portal. Additionally, formatting sites for mobile is
            a very tedious and annoying process and was my least favorite part of creating this site. I would not change much about how I approached making
            my class portal. I like the result and I believe I did it as efficiently as possible.

            The first line of code was styled in Javascript through the DOM. This completes the first requirement of manipulating a css
            property through the DOM. I killed two birds with one stone in the second line of code. I added an event listener for a mouse click. When the 
            text is clicked on, the text presented changes. This is not a CSS property and it is one type of event of two for this assignment. The final line
            has event listeners for when the mouse hovers over and off the text. When the mouse is hovering over the text, the text changes color. It reverts
            back to the original color if the mouse is not hovering over it. Overall, this assignment was fairly simple. I had a few challenges because it
            has been a few months since I have used Javascript, so I simply had to refresh my memory.

            Present in this assignment:
                - Input type "submit"
                - Input type "number"
                - Input type "datetime-local"
                - Input type "color"
                - 'select' and 'option'
            This was another simple assignment. I had a bit of trouble figuring out the Javascript syntax so that it takes the user input and manipulates
            the page directly based on the input, however with some time I figured it out. I was not too worried about the aesthetics/style of this webpage
            as I was more focused on meeting all the requirements. 

            The first form lets the user enter a number 1-100. Upon clicking submit, the webpage alerts the user with the number they entered. The second
            form has the datetime-local input type. The date and the time that the user clicks is displayed in the console. The third form gives the user
            a list of colors that they could select. Their selection changes the color of the text on the page. The last form is a color picker which manipulates
            the background color of the page.
