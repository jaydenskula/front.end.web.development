            I began with creating and styling the home page for my portal. As I said for milestone 1, I wanted a very simple class portal that's easy to 
            navigate. I then went on to formatting my assignments, projects, and process blog page. At the very end of my process, I added some more
            customization and implemented a small animation and drop shadow when the mouse hovers over any of the links. My class portal took about
            3-4 hours to create. It was not particularly difficult to create, but I did run into a few challenges. I often had to reference some old code from
            my previous web class because I did not remember how to implement what I wanted into my class portal. Additionally, formatting sites for mobile is
            a very tedious and annoying process and was my least favorite part of creating this site. I would not change much about how I approached making
            my class portal. I like the result and I believe I did it as efficiently as possible.

            The first line of code was styled in Javascript through the DOM. This completes the first requirement of manipulating a css
            property through the DOM. I killed two birds with one stone in the second line of code. I added an event listener for a mouse click. When the 
            text is clicked on, the text presented changes. This is not a CSS property and it is one type of event of two for this assignment. The final line
            has event listeners for when the mouse hovers over and off the text. When the mouse is hovering over the text, the text changes color. It reverts
            back to the original color if the mouse is not hovering over it. Overall, this assignment was fairly simple. I had a few challenges because it
            has been a few months since I have used Javascript, so I simply had to refresh my memory.

            Present in this assignment:
                - Input type "submit"
                - Input type "number"
                - Input type "datetime-local"
                - Input type "color"
                - 'select' and 'option'
            This was another simple assignment. I had a bit of trouble figuring out the Javascript syntax so that it takes the user input and manipulates
            the page directly based on the input, however with some time I figured it out. I was not too worried about the aesthetics/style of this webpage
            as I was more focused on meeting all the requirements. 

            The first form lets the user enter a number 1-100. Upon clicking submit, the webpage alerts the user with the number they entered. The second
            form has the datetime-local input type. The date and the time that the user clicks is displayed in the console. The third form gives the user
            a list of colors that they could select. Their selection changes the color of the text on the page. The last form is a color picker which manipulates
            the background color of the page.

            I had a bit of trouble finding an API for this assignment as many were blocked by the CORS policy. Unsurprisingly, the biggest
            challenge I had with this assignment was writing the JavaScript. I had the most fun styling the page because I had a lot of 
            creative freedom. I wanted to make my page more interactive so I added a button to generate a new activity on click and styled it. 
            This provides a more intuitive way to call to the API for different text than simply reloading the page by clicking reload at the 
            top of the browser window. Overall, this assignment was short and straight foward.

            For my project, I want to create a small text-based adventure in Javascript. The user will be presented with scenarios with which they 
            can take different actions. There will be an animated background that changes based on the scenario and choices the user
            makes.The purpose for my site is to be visually appealing and hopefully something that I can proudly present in my portfolio. The target 
            audience would be anyone who wants to see what I have created during my college career. It will also be a short and sweet little activity 
            for people who are bored.
        </p>

        <p class="entry-text">
            I have a passion for animation so I knew I wanted my project to include it. My project will also be inspired by text-based games like A Dark Room.
            Below is a basic idea of what I want my project to look like:
        </p>

        <img src="./img/wireframe.jpg" width=900>

        <p class="entry-text">
            For my project, the new JavaScript library I plan on learning is <a href="https://animejs.com/">anime.js</a>. Since I have never utilized this
            library, I plan on beginning with watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6vIxQA_bgs">this video</a> as a brief introduction. A
            majority of my webpage will be coded in JavaScript. In other words, my entire project will rely on Javascript for functionality and maximum
            quality user experience. The art for the backgrounds will not be created in JavaScript, however the liveliness of them and the animation will 
            be implemented through JavaScript. In order for it to be compatible with different screen sizes, I plan on changing the sizes of the background
            images and potentially will have to change the animation parameters. I will also have to adjust the size and layout of any text that will
            appear on the screen. My goals for this project are to learn more about JavaScript and animation. I don't want to just finish my 
            project for a completion grade, I want it to be a valuable display of my skills and coding abilities for people to see.

        I have the opening of my game set up. Upon clicking the 'play' button, a series of animations using anime.js will play and set the scene for my mini
        game. Afterwards, a button saying 'light fire' will transition down. Upon being clicked, small white text will appear, telling you that you lit a fire.

        I did not accomplish as much as I wanted to for this project. I can't help but be a bit disappointed with myself, however I do genuinely
        like my idea and I want to continue to work on it. I can easily say that a big takeaway from this project is that I have a lack of understanding
        of scope and scale. I need to be more aware of how much I will be able to realistically accomplish in a set amount of time. Learning a completely
        new JavaScript library, especially when I do not have extensive experience with JavaScript by itself, was daunting. However, Anime JS was simple to
        implement, fairly simple to learn, and fun to use. Anime JS will definitely be on my radar for future web development projects. For this project
        specifically, I used the animation timeline feature Anime JS offers. The library offers so many different components and options so I hope that, as 
        I use it more often, I will get a chance to use its other features and get more comfortable with it overall.
        </p>

        <p class="entry-text">
        My creative and technical process for this project was somewhat straightforward. While there was an artistic piece in my project, the JS code was
        the most important to implement. Because of this, I used temporary, lower effort image assets to utilize while I was still developing the code to 
        make sure, first and foremost, that it was functional and ran smoothly. After the code was fully functional, I created my final image assets for 
        aesthetic and visual satisfaction. The critique day that we had in class was also helpful, as I got cool recommendations on how to enhance the 
        experience and I did my best to fulfill the feedback that was given to me. I had a lot of fun with this project. While I did not accomplish
        everything I set out to do, I want to take time outside of school to further develop it and create a finished project that I am truly proud of.

            We have made significant progress on our project so far. During Thanksgiving break, Wilson implemented the Pokemon API. During a class, Ana did some of
            the styling for our site so each Pokemon displayed as their own "cards" in a grid. In my own time, I used react to add interaction to our site. Each Pokemon has
            a "more info" button that displays details of the Pokemon that was clicked. The additional information disappears if the button is clicked again. I ran into
            some formatting issues which were solved in class. I also had an issue that all the info was displayed at once when one of the buttons was clicked. This was solved
            by putting the react function in a separate jsx file.

            Wilson and I spent a good amount of time doing more styling for our site. We wanted the information cards to look like actual Pokemon cards.
            We were having a little bit of trouble with the images because they all appeared to be different sizes. We realized that the issue was caused by the fact that
            our css defined maximum height instead of just the height. Some images did not reach the maximum height and therefore displayed in different sizes.
            Our site adapts to mobile screens. In terms of our goals, we have reached all of them other than the design. The site could look better and needs 
            some work, however we have implemented interaction and accessibility which were our minimum goals. Below are some photos of what we have implemented so far.
